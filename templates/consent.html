                    You have been invited to take part in a research study named Word Learning. The study is designed to investigate how people learn in dynamic tasks. It will be conducted by George Kachergis, a researcher at the Department of Psychology, New York University.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to look at pictures of objects (e.g., geometric figures or photographs of everyday objects) presented on a computer display and make judgments about them. Participation in this study will take about ten minutes to complete, and you will receive $1.50 for your participation. When you complete the study, a thorough verbal and written explanation of it will be provided. In addition, by agreeing to participate, you understand you must be 18 years or older to participate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand how people learn new categories.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. We assign code numbers to each participant so that data is never directly linked to individual identity, and we are interested in group results rather than the responses of particular individuals. Data are kept in out laboratory and are only viewed by the investigators. These data files are kept on our computer indefinitely.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Taking part in this study is voluntary. Not taking part or withdrawing after the study has begun will result in no loss of services from NYU to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact George Kachergis, george.kachergis@gmail.com.
